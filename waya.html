    <p>Wayanad, the panoramic hill of malabar in the northern Kerala, situated above the sea level ranges between 700 meters to 2100 meters, is a homeland of various tribal communities.They can be prominently classified into Paniyas, Adiyas, Kattunayakans, Kurichiyans,Kurumas,Ooralis, Uraali Kurumas etc.</p>

<br>
<p>A vast majority of tribes in Kerala state hail from the Paniya tribal sect. Paniyas inhabit in the regions of Wayanad and the neighboring parts of Kannur and Malappuram.

    Paniyas, tribes, Wayanad, Kerala, IndiaAs bond labourers, the Paniyas were once sold along with plantations by the landlords. They were also employed as professional coffee thieves by higher castes. The name 'Paniyaan' means 'worker' as they were supposed to have been the workers of non - tribes.
    
    Monogamy appears to be the general rule among the Paniyas. In marriage bride price is practiced like many other tribal communities. Widow remarriage is allowed. They do not practice pre-puberty marriage.They have only a crude idea of religion. Their major deity, is called 'Kali'. They also worship Banyan tree. They hesitate to cut such trees and if anyone attempts to cut such trees, they fall sick.
    
    Due to the various tribal welfare programmes by the government, a change has set in the lives of Paniyas</p>
